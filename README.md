## Simple Domain.com.au scraper

A very simple domain.com.au rental listing scraper to compare listings as there is no compare
option in domain. So this script pulls in `X` number of listing that helps you compare domain's
rental listing as coming to a new city it is a very handy thing to have.


### Disclaimer

Very irresponsible and hacky software ahead that works and does the job :).

### Run

`node index.js` gives out domain-rentals-{timestamp}.csv in the same directory with some fields for comparision like rent, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, no. of parking, available from etc.

### Tests

Would have been good to have them, it is just a useful hack. 

### Contributions

Yes of course, there are lots of things to improve. Any contribution/PR is really welcome.
